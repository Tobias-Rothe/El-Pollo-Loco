        <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
        <h3>Liability for content</h3>
        <p>
          The contents of our pages were created with the greatest care. However, we cannot
          guarantee the accuracy, completeness, and timeliness of the content. As a service
          provider, we are responsible for our own content on these pages according to § 7 Abs.1 DDG
          under general laws. According to §§ 8 to 10 DDG, we are not obligated as a service
          provider to monitor transmitted or stored third-party information or to investigate
          circumstances that indicate illegal activity. Obligations to remove or block the use of
          information under general laws remain unaffected. However, liability in this regard is
          only possible from the time of knowledge of a specific infringement. Upon becoming aware
          of such violations, we will remove this content immediately.
        </p>
        <h3>Liability for links</h3>
        <p>
          Our offer contains links to external websites of third parties, on whose contents we have
          no influence. Therefore, we cannot assume any liability for these external contents. The
          respective provider or operator of the pages is always responsible for the contents of the
          linked pages. The linked pages were checked for possible legal violations at the time of
          linking. Illegal contents were not recognizable at the time of linking. A permanent
          content control of the linked pages is not reasonable without concrete evidence of a
          violation of the law. Upon becoming aware of legal violations, we will remove such links
          immediately.
        </p>
        <h3>Copyright</h3>
        <p>
          The content and works created by the site operators on these pages are subject to German
          copyright law. The duplication, processing, distribution, and any kind of exploitation
          outside the limits of copyright require the written consent of the respective author or
          creator. Downloads and copies of this site are only permitted for private, non-commercial
          use. Insofar as the content on this site was not created by the operator, the copyrights
          of third parties are respected. In particular, third-party content is marked as such.
          Should you nevertheless become aware of a copyright infringement, please inform us
          accordingly. Upon becoming aware of legal violations, we will remove such content
          immediately.
        </p>
        <h3>Data protection</h3>
        <p>
          The use of our website is usually possible without providing personal data. Insofar as
          personal data (for example, name, address, or email addresses) are collected on our pages,
          this is always done on a voluntary basis as far as possible. These data will not be passed
          on to third parties without your express consent.
          <br />
          We point out that data transmission over the Internet (e.g., communication by email) can
          have security gaps. A complete protection of the data from access by third parties is not
          possible.
          <br />
          The use of contact data published within the framework of the imprint obligation by third
          parties for sending unsolicited advertising and information materials is hereby expressly
          prohibited. The operators of the pages expressly reserve the right to take legal action in
          the event of unsolicited sending of advertising information, such as spam emails.
